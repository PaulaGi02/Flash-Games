# FlashPlay

## Description:
FlashPlay is a gamified learning app. Players start by importing or creating a deck of flashcards, which becomes the foundation for a series of interactive minigames. In total you can choose between three different mini games: 
1. Memory Game: The flashcards are upside-down and youu have to find the matching pairs
2. Snake Race: You race against a timed snake. If you answer the question correctly you get faster, if you answer incorrectly your snake gets slower
3. Package Sorter: On a production line small "Packages" with the front and back of a flashcards comes rolling in and you have to see if the back and fronts matches. If they do you drag them into the right box (correct) if they do not match you drag them into the left box (incorrect). If you are to slow and the card leaves the screen you loose one of three lives.
